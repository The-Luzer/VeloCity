# VeloCity (Virtual Pinball X)

Welcome to the repository for **VeloCity**, a Virtual Pinball X (VPX) table!

To keep development clean and organized, this repository stores the extracted source files (scripts, images, sounds) rather than the heavy binary game file.

## 🎮 How to Play

If you just want to play the game, you don't need to mess with any code or tools!

1. Go to the **Releases** tab on the right side of this GitHub page.
2. Download the latest `velocity.vpx` file.
3. Open the file in [Visual Pinball X](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball) and hit Play!
